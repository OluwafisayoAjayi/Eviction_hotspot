# Eviction_hotspot
EvictionHotspots is an R package designed to help researchers, policymakers, and advocates analyze eviction data and identify spatial eviction hotspots. The package provides tools for performing spatial autocorrelation analysis using Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and visualizing hotspots through both static and interactive maps.

With this package, users can uncover patterns of housing instability, identify areas most affected by evictions, and support data-driven policymaking for housing justice. 


Features
Calculate global Moran's I to assess overall spatial autocorrelation in eviction data.
Compute local Moran's I (LISA) to detect eviction hotspots.
Visualize eviction hotspots on static maps (using tmap) or interactive maps (using leaflet).
Seamlessly integrate spatial data using the sf package.
